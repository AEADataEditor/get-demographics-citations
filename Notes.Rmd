Install packages necessary
```{r}

install.packages(c("rcrossref", "purrr","tidyr", "dplyr"))

```
call libraries

```{r}
library(rcrossref)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

```

Used cr_journals to get example journal data (AEJ: App) and put into table titled articles
```{r}
cr_journals(
  issn = c('1945-7790','2640-2068'),
  cursor = "*" ,
  works = TRUE
) |> purrr::pluck("data") -> articles


```
Will now untangle articles to get indiv authors as item of interest
Keeping issn because I will want to add more journals
```{r}
articles |> 
  select(doi, author, issn) |>
  unnest(author) -> authors

```

Break down affiliations, some authors have multiple

```{r}

```
